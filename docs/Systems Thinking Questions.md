# **Systems Thinking Questions for Nonprofit Organizations**

## **1\. Purpose & Problem Definition**

* What problem are we actually trying to solve?  
* How do we know this is the real problem and not a symptom of something deeper?  
* Who defines the problem, and who is most affected by it?  
* What assumptions are we making about the causes of this problem?

## **2\. Stakeholders & Interconnections**

* Who are all the stakeholders (internal and external) connected to this issue?  
* How do their motivations, incentives, and constraints influence the system?  
* What relationships exist between these stakeholders? Where are they weak or strong?  
* Who benefits from the system staying the way it is? Who is harmed?

## **3\. Inputs, Activities, and Flows**

* What resources, people, or information flow into our system?  
* Where are the bottlenecks, delays, or friction points?  
* Who controls the critical resources or information flows?  
* How does work move through our organization, and where does it break down?

## **4\. Patterns, Trends, and Feedback Loops**

* What patterns or trends do we see over time (not just in single events)?  
* What are reinforcing (snowballing) loops that make a problem grow?  
* What are balancing (stabilizing) loops that slow or contain change?  
* Which behaviors repeat, and what triggers them?

## **5\. Root Causes & Underlying Dynamics**

* What structural factors are keeping this problem in place (policies, culture, economics)?  
* What mental models (beliefs, assumptions) drive behaviors in this system?  
* Where do we see misaligned incentives?  
* What would make this problem go away permanently?


## **6\. Boundaries & Context**

* What are the boundaries of the system we’re addressing — and what’s outside them?  
* How does the larger environment (policy, funding, community, culture) shape the system?  
* What historical events created today’s dynamics?

## **7\. Leverage Points**

* Where could a small change create a disproportionately big impact?  
* What upstream interventions could reduce downstream problems?  
* What existing strengths or assets can we amplify?  
* What rules, processes, or norms could we change that would unlock improvement?

## **8\. Unintended Consequences**

* If we implement this solution, what might we unintentionally break or disrupt?  
* Could our intervention make anything worse for certain groups?  
* How might people adapt to or work around the changes?  
* What could this create more of (bureaucracy, demand, dependency, etc.)?

## **9\. Equity & Power Dynamics**

* Who has power in this system? Who doesn’t?  
* How are decisions made — and who is left out of decision-making?  
* Who benefits from our interventions? Who might be excluded?  
* How will the system be different for people with different backgrounds or identities?

## **10\. Learning & Adaptation**

* What data or feedback do we need to really understand what’s happening?  
* How quickly do we learn from mistakes or adapt to new information?  
* What early signals would show us our intervention is working (or not)?  
* How can we test ideas through small pilots before scaling them?

## **11\. Time Horizons**

* What will this problem look like in 1 year? In 5 years?  
* Are we focused too much on short-term fixes instead of long-term solutions?  
* How will today’s decisions shape tomorrow’s system?

## **12\. Vision & Alignment**

* How does this system behave when it is working well?  
* What shared vision are we trying to move the system toward?  
* What would success look like if all parts of the system were aligned?
