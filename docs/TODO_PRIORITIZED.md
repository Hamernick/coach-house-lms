# Prioritized To-Do (Easy to Hard)

Source: "Notes re LMS" list from 2025-12-30. Ordered by rough effort/risk.

Legend: XS = hours, S = 1 day, M = few days, L = 1-2 weeks, XL = multi-week.

1. XS - Accept plain domains for website fields (auto-prepend https). DONE
2. XS - Fix/verify logo upload works end-to-end.  DONE
3. XS - People tab action button: change "Create" to "Add" and simplify. DONE
4. XS - Add a submit feedback button (location TBD). DONE
5. MOVE - needs to be towards the last thing we do... S - Notifications cleanup: remove placeholder types, define real events, move toasts top-right. 
6. S - Programs image container sizing (too small), i can see the edges of the image when it should be clipped by the card/header so the top left/right corners rounded/contained by that container...
