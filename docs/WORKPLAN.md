# Work Plan (Draft)

## Now
- Mapbox: confirm token load on /community + dashboard; surface runtime errors and ensure localhost is permitted.
- Strategic roadmap UX: stabilize layout widths, responsive sections picker, tidy action row, consistent editor sizing.
- My Organization: keep roadmap tab + org profile display clean (HTML stripped, values as text).

## Next
- Pricing page redesign for OpenNFP tiers ($99/mo middle tier); tighten layout and CTA placement.
- Notifications menu next to theme toggle; add checkpoint prompt to schedule with Joel/Paula.
- AI Assist: open-in-ChatGPT flow with org/user context payload strategy.
- Scheduling: Google Calendar integration with free tier cap (4 meetings).
- Dark/light/system theming fixes (news/home, progress card).

## Blockers / Needs
- Confirm Mapbox token restrictions (allow localhost + required scopes).
- Finalized lesson/module list + video/deck mapping (CSV + buckets).
- Clarify local-only "go live" behavior and public visibility controls.

## Notes
- Source of truth for lesson ordering: `docs/lessons-modules-list.csv`.
