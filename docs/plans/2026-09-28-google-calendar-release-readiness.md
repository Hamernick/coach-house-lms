# Google Calendar release readiness — 2026-09-28

Calendar is the selected next lane per Caleb. This is a source/evidence audit, not
an activation or release authorization. Main inspected: `aa2fc54f` after fetch.

## Already implemented

- Main contains the Calendar feature, OAuth/API routes, encrypted credentials,
  private event cache, incremental import, optional board export, pause/resume,
  disconnect, authenticated cron handler, migration, and acceptance/RLS coverage.
- `src/features/google-calendar/**` and
  `src/app/api/integrations/google-calendar/**` are byte-identical between main
  and the scoped backup `chore/google-calendar-20260924` (`a1acccad`).
- AppShell/mobile is closed. Compose Calendar with its shipped implementation;
  do not reopen the general mobile lane.
- Google branding/data-access approval was recorded in the September 15 inventory
  assessment as confirmed September 14. Older setup instructions saying approval
  is pending are stale. Provider state was not independently inspected today.

## Remaining work, in order

1. Prepare an isolated release worktree from fresh main. Adapt the owned changes
   from `a1acccad`; do not merge the mixed root or old review branch wholesale.
   The backup patch has 41 files, including docs, fixtures and images, not 41
   unfinished runtime files. No new release worktree was created in this audit.
2. Integrate the missing Workspace Tools Calendar entry/status/switch and roadmap
   personal events/Google controls. Port the saved Calendar overlay lifecycle fix
   (unmount closed overlays, retain selected date/month) and focused regression.
   Preserve current AppShell/mobile behavior and current acceptance-manifest entries.
   Shared schema index changes in the backup are formatting-only; omit that churn.
3. Let Caleb review the working integrated UI: Tools setup and status, personal
   event display, Calendar settings, and close/reopen behavior on desktop/mobile.
   Use existing fixtures first. An authenticated local app may share production
   data; do not treat its connection controls as disposable test operations.
4. Read-only production configuration audit: Calendar flag, dedicated OAuth client
   and callback, Calendar API/scopes, encryption key/version, cron authentication,
   migration history, and actual scheduler. September 9 recorded Production
   variables present, flag false, migration applied and no scheduler; those facts
   need current verification. Main has a cron endpoint but no `vercel.json`.
   This does not prove an external scheduler is absent. Reconcile the older setup
   guide with newer approval/migration evidence; do not repeat approved setup.
5. Define an authorized canary account/calendar/workspace and cleanup scope. Prove
   timed/recurring/all-day import, visibility isolation from another member,
   pause/resume, reconnect, and disconnect without breaking Drive/login or deleting
   Google-native events. If optional export ships, prove authorized create/update/
   cancel, retry without duplicates and access-loss behavior in a disposable export
   destination. Reuse valid user evidence; avoid repeated consent as a generic retry.
6. Choose and verify scheduled-sync cadence and capacity. Code accepts an authenticated
   GET, handles at most ten due accounts within 45 seconds, and schedules successful
   accounts five minutes later. Confirm host support/cost before scheduler creation.
7. Run focused existing Calendar/service, roadmap, Workspace Tools and interaction
   checks for the integrated changes. Review visuals with Caleb before updating
   affected Linux references. Require current-revision hosted `quality`, code-owner
   review and branch protection; then separately authorize activation/deployment and
   verify production. Rollback: disable Calendar and stop scheduled sync, preserving
   encrypted connection rows and keys.

## Evidence and limits

- GitHub PR [#237](https://github.com/Hamernick/coach-house-lms/pull/237) is still
  draft/open at `6ce80db6`; its static, acceptance, RLS, build, visual and aggregate
  quality checks are green. It is historical evidence, not a current-main release.
- September 22 resume `508b8df0` recorded focused Calendar/roadmap/Tools 41 tests,
  Drive revocation 37 tests, static, full acceptance, RLS, build/performance and
  11 Calendar visuals passing. No tests were rerun during this read-only code audit.
- Production provider configuration, scheduler, deployed flag and live canary were
  not verified today. No provider mutation, application change, push or deployment.
- Root has only this audit/handoff documentation work; its application snapshot is
  preservation-only. Keep the root server and all existing worktrees intact.

## Implementation checkpoint — 2026-09-28

- Release branch: `feat/google-calendar-release-20260928`, based on `aa2fc54f`.
  Worktree: `/Users/calebhamernick/Development/coach-house-platform-google-calendar-release-20260928`.
- Remaining Tools and roadmap integration is ported. Calendar has the saved mobile
  sidebar entry and accessible close control, while keeping current Menu/dock/Details
  behavior. Closed overlays unmount and retain the selected date/month on reopening.
- Removed automatic development-only demo-event creation: opening an empty calendar
  must not create 60 records in the shared database. Explicit event creation remains.
- Preview: `http://localhost:3012/workspace?drawer=tools`. Private, ignored environment
  copies reuse the existing Calendar local callback and credentials; no provider
  configuration changed. Treat authenticated connection controls as shared-data writes.
- Node 22 evidence: 52 focused tests and seven existing mocked browser behavior tests
  pass. Feature/route/boundary/interaction/React Grab/scaffold/raw-button checks and
  acceptance inventory pass. Browser runs used an ignored temporary behavior-only
  config; no macOS visual comparisons or baseline updates. Preserved screenshots,
  including the two reviewed Linux setup references from `6ce80db6`, are restored
  as prior evidence only; current-head Linux CI and user appearance review remain.
- Read-only Vercel inspection returned HTTP 403 using the existing local CLI credential.
  Production flag, variables and scheduler remain unverified; no credential refresh or
  provider mutation was attempted. Google approval remains previously recorded evidence.
- Next: Caleb reviews this integration, resolve reported issues, complete authorized
  provider/canary checks, and pass current-revision hosted release gates.

Production build also passes under Node 22; Graphify code graph refreshed (19,381 nodes).

Final performance follow-up: the first integrated build exceeded the admin budget
(1,001 KB / 1,000 KB). Lazy-loading the Calendar action in the desktop header/mobile
sidebar resolved it without changing limits or removing controls. The final build
and all route budgets pass: admin 994.9 KB, community 607.4 KB, public map 1,821.9 KB.
Twelve shell/navigation tests pass after the lazy-loading change (56 unique focused
tests across the validation passes). Unauthenticated Calendar connection and cron
requests both return 401. Changed-file lint, structure and staged secret scan pass.
