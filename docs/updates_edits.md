ORIGIN STORY COPY [done]
Many people freeze when asked to “tell their story,” but relax when asked to assemble a few components.
You don’t need to get this perfect. In fact, you don’t need to write a polished story at all.
If you’d like, you can use one of your coaching sessions to develop your origin story. In those sessions, we interview you, draft an origin story on your behalf, and then work with you to revise and refine it until it feels true to you and aligned with your work.
Alternatively, you can answer the questions below. Your responses will serve as the raw material for an initial draft that you can revisit and strengthen later.

Where are you from? (This can be a place, a community, a family context, or a formative environment.)
What experiences in your life led to your concern about—and commitment to addressing—the problem you’re working on? (Moments, patterns, or lived experiences that shaped how you see this issue.)
Why do you believe this work matters now, and why do you feel called to be part of it?

Theory of Change — Homework Guidance
Many people freeze when asked to develop a Theory of Change, but relax when asked to assemble a few clear components.
You don’t need to get this perfect. In fact, you don’t need to produce a final or polished Theory of Change at this stage.
We highly encourage using a coaching session for this work. In coaching, we help you develop a clear through line from your Need Statement → Mission, Vision, Values → Theory of Change, ensuring everything is aligned, logical, and funder-ready.
If you choose to do this without coaching, you can use an AI platform to support your first draft:
Enter your Need Statement
Enter your Mission, Vision, and Values
Ask the platform to generate three versions of an “If / Then / So” Theory of Change
Then review and reflect:
Which version most clearly identifies—and responds to—the need described in your Need Statement?
“If”: Is this truly what you intend to do?
“Then”: Is this the real difference you aim to make—and plan to measure?
“So”: Does this outcome meaningfully connect back to the problem you set out to address?
Your goal is not perfection. Your goal is clarity. This draft will be refined as we move forward.

SYSTEMS THINKING: [done]
The open systems thinking questions button doesn’t work. It just opens another window. [done]

Remove the existing set of questions and response boxes. Reduce it to the following questions. [done]

Systems Thinking — Program Design Reflection
Applying today’s lesson is about thinking critically and creatively as you move from describing a problem to designing an actual program. Systems thinking helps you slow down just enough to consider how change might happen—not just what you want to do.
With that in mind, fill in the following boxes. This exercise is not about getting the “right” answer; it’s about thinking thoughtfully about how your program fits within a broader system.

1. Program Snapshot
In 1–3 sentences, describe the program you are thinking about. What does it do, and who is it for?

2. What Problem Is This Program Responding To—and What Contributes to It?
What conditions, behaviors, policies, or gaps help create the problem your program is addressing? Which of these does your program directly touch—and which does it not?

3. What Else Is Connected to This Program’s Success?
Who or what needs to change, cooperate, or function well for this program to succeed? Consider participants, families, partners, institutions, incentives, or constraints.

4. If This Program Works Well, What Changes—and for Whom?
Beyond immediate participants, who else experiences a difference? What might improve, shift, or become easier elsewhere as a result of this program?

5. What Assumption Are You Making About How Change Will Happen?
What are you assuming must be true for this program to work as intended? What would you want to test or learn through piloting the program?

PROGRAM PILOTING:
[pending] Joel needs to develop a video describing the SE CBA as a pilot.

PROGRAM MODELS:

BUDGETING FOR AN ORGANIZATION: [done]
Add for homework:

A Note on Organizational Budgets
Moving from a program budget to a full organizational budget is an important shift. Unlike a program budget, an organizational budget brings together multiple programs, shared staff, administrative costs, and overhead into a single financial picture.
Because of this added complexity, an organizational budget is rarely created effectively using a simple table alone.
We strongly recommend using a coaching session for this step. During coaching, we work with you to build your organizational budget directly in Excel or Google Sheets, helping you:
* Translate program-level costs into an organization-wide budget
* Allocate shared expenses thoughtfully across programs
* Understand cash flow, timing, and sustainability
* Create a budget that is usable for fundraising, board review, and day-to-day decision-making
If your organization has a bookkeeper or finance lead, they are welcome to join the coaching session. This allows us to align the budget with any existing or planned financial systems, such as QuickBooks or Monkeypod, and ensure that your budgeting approach connects cleanly to real-world bookkeeping and reporting.
If you choose to work on this independently, view your first organizational budget as a draft—a tool for learning and iteration rather than a final product.
Clarity, not perfection, is the goal.


MULTI YEAR BUDGETING: [done]

[done] The video needs to be added to the LMS. It is in the dropbox folder as of 12/30.

Homework language below the video: [done]

Preparing for a Multi-Year Budget
Before building a multi-year budget, it’s important to step back and clarify your intentions and assumptions. A multi-year budget is not just a financial exercise—it is a reflection of your strategy, priorities, and capacity for growth.
Answer the questions below to prepare for this work.

1. Growth & Direction
Over the next 2–3 years, what do you want to happen to your organization?
* ☐ Maintain current size and scope
* ☐ Grow intentionally
* ☐ Not sure yet
If growth is a goal, what do you expect to grow? (Check all that apply.)
* ☐ Number of people served
* ☐ Number of sessions, cohorts, or gatherings
* ☐ Number of programs
* ☐ Geographic reach
* ☐ Depth or intensity of services
* ☐ All of the above
Briefly describe what growth would look like in practice.

2. Program Implications
If your programs expand or change, what would need to be different?
* More staff or facilitators?
* More space or longer program timelines?
* Higher per-participant costs?
* Additional evaluation or reporting requirements?
What assumptions are you currently making about how growth would happen?

3. Future Expenses Not Reflected Today
Are there expenses you expect in Year 2 or Year 3 that are not included in your current budget?
Consider items such as:
* Additional staff positions
* Salary increases or benefits
* Professional services (accounting, legal, HR)
* Equipment or technology purchases
* Vehicles or specialized tools
* Facility costs or real estate
* Insurance or compliance-related costs
List any anticipated future expenses and when they might occur.

4. Capacity & Sustainability
What would need to be true for your organization to support this growth responsibly?
* Leadership capacity
* Staff or volunteer bandwidth
* Fundraising or earned revenue growth
* Systems and infrastructure
Where do you feel confident—and where do you feel uncertain?

5. Who Should Be Part of This Conversation?
A strong multi-year budget benefits from multiple perspectives.
Who should be involved or consulted as you think about the next 2–3 years?
* ☐ Key staff
* ☐ Board members
* ☐ Bookkeeper or accountant
* ☐ Program partners
* ☐ Volunteers or community advisors
List specific people you would want to invite into this planning process.

Coaching Recommendation
We strongly recommend using a coaching session to translate these reflections into a practical multi-year budget. During coaching, we can include key voices—such as staff, board members, partners, or finance professionals—to ensure your assumptions are realistic, shared, and aligned with your organization’s capacity.
This approach helps turn long-range thinking into a credible, usable financial plan.

MID YEAR BUDGET REVIEW
[done] This video is not yet produced as of 12/30.


FROM BUDGETING TO BOOKKEEPING: [done]

From Budgeting to Bookkeeping

This lesson focuses on making sure the plans you’ve developed—program budgets, organizational budgets, and multi-year projections—connect cleanly to how money is actually recorded, reported, and reviewed.
The most important next step after this lesson is a conversation.
We strongly recommend scheduling a conversation with your bookkeeper or accountant to review:
* How your budget structure aligns with your chart of accounts
* Whether your programs and expense categories can be tracked clearly
* How often financial reports should be reviewed and by whom
* What information is needed for board oversight, funders, and audits
You may choose to prepare for this conversation in a coaching session, where we help you:
* Clarify what questions to ask
* Translate your budget into bookkeeping-friendly categories
* Identify gaps between planning and reporting
* Feel confident leading the conversation
Alternatively, we can join the conversation with your bookkeeper or accountant. In these sessions, we help align strategy, budgeting, and bookkeeping in real time—ensuring that your financial systems support decision-making rather than creating confusion.
The goal is not complexity. The goal is clarity, consistency, and confidence in how your organization manages its finances.

READING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: [done]

Reading Nonprofit Financial Statements
Understanding your organization’s financial statements is a core leadership responsibility. You don’t need to be an accountant—but you do need to know how to read, ask questions, and interpret what you’re seeing.
This lesson introduces the three core nonprofit financial statements and what they are designed to tell you about the health of your organization.
We highly recommend reviewing these statements with your bookkeeper or accountant. Doing so helps ensure that:
* You understand how the statements are generated
* The numbers reflect how your organization actually operates
* You can spot trends, risks, or questions early
* Financial reporting supports board oversight and decision-making
If your organization does not yet have financial statements, but is ready to begin preparing them using accounting software, we recommend Monkeypod. Monkeypod combines nonprofit-friendly accounting software with efficient bookkeeping services, making it easier to produce accurate financial statements and understand them as a leader. Bookkeeping support is available starting at approximately $300 per month, making it a practical option for early-stage and growing organizations.
You may also choose to use a coaching session to prepare for or support this work. In coaching, we help you:
* Learn how to read financial statements with confidence
* Identify the key questions nonprofit leaders should ask
* Connect financial reports back to budgets and strategy
* Prepare for productive conversations with finance professionals and board members
Coaching sessions can be used either to prepare for a conversation with a bookkeeper or accountant, or to include them directly so that everyone is aligned around shared understanding.
The goal is not to master accounting. The goal is to become a financially literate nonprofit leader.

FUNDRAISING MINDSET [done]
What idea or reframing from this lesson most shifted how you think about fundraising—and why did it resonate with you?

SEGMENTATION: [done]

1. What insight from this lesson helped you better understand why different donors respond to different messages or approaches? (In other words, what clicked for you about donor behavior?)
2. Which donor segment or donor type feels most natural or energizing for you to engage right now—and what makes that a good fit for your organization at this stage?
3. After reviewing segmentation, what is one small change you could make to communicate more intentionally with a specific group of donors or supporters? (This could be about tone, frequency, content, or the “next best step.”)

TREASURE MAPPING: [done]

Treasure Mapping Exercise: From Contacts to Conversations

The following exercise is designed to work especially well for small or startup organizations and can be completed by a single founder or volunteer leader. Coach House is available to help you translate your existing phone, email, and other contact lists into a clear, actionable fundraising strategy.
For larger organizations with an active CRM, this exercise is just as valuable—but it is most effective when done collaboratively. We recommend completing it with key staff, board members, or leadership volunteers to more fully surface relationships and brainstorm names across each treasure circle.

DONOR JOURNEY: [done]
Homework: From Names to a Donor Journey Strategy
This assignment builds directly on your Segmentation and Treasure Mapping lists. The goal is to move from who to how by identifying where each person is in the donor journey and defining a clear next step.

Step 1: Return to Your Lists
Using the names you identified in Module 2 (Segmentation) and Module 3 (Treasure Mapping), select 5–10 individuals or organizations you could realistically engage over the next 60–90 days.
These should be people you already know, have access to, or could reasonably reconnect with.

Step 2: Identify Their Current Stage
For each name, identify where you believe they currently are in the Donor Journey:
* ☐ Identify – They are on your radar but not yet meaningfully connected
* ☐ Introduce – They are aware of your work but not yet engaged
* ☐ Cultivate – They are engaged and learning, but not yet giving (or not yet giving consistently)
* ☐ Steward – They have given and need thoughtful follow-up and relationship-building
This does not need to be perfect — your best informed judgment is enough.

Step 3: Define the Next Action Step
For each person, identify one clear next action that aligns with their stage in the journey:
Examples:
* Invite to coffee or a short intro call
* Send a personal email with a single impact story
* Invite to a small gathering or event
* Share a meaningful update or behind-the-scenes story
* Send a thank-you or follow-up tied to past support
* Ask for advice, feedback, or perspective
Focus on connection, not the ask, unless the relationship is clearly ready for it.

Step 4: Capture It Simply
For each name, write down:
* Name
* Treasure Circle
* Donor Journey Stage
* Next Action Step
* Target timeframe (e.g., next 2 weeks, next month)
This can live in a spreadsheet, CRM, or simple document.

Closing Reflection (1–2 sentences)
What did you notice when you shifted from “a list of names” to seeing each person as part of an intentional relationship journey?


Exercise Step 1: Where Are Your People Now?
1. Do you currently use a CRM (Customer Relationship Management system)?
    * ☐ Yes
    * ☐ No
2. If no, where do your existing contacts live today? (Check all that apply)
    * ☐ Email inbox
    * ☐ Phone contacts
    * ☐ LinkedIn connections
    * ☐ Other social media platforms
    * ☐ Spreadsheets or documents
    * ☐ Personal memory / notes
    * ☐ Other: ___________________
Note: Your fundraising ecosystem already exists — this exercise helps you surface it.

Exercise Step 2: Pull Names from What You Already Have
1. Using the sources above, list people or organizations you already know, have interacted with, or could reasonably reconnect with. Don’t filter yet — write freely. (Aim for at least 15–25 names total before sorting.)

Exercise Step 3: Map Names to the Treasure Circles
1. Place names into the Treasure Mapping Circles below. Choose people you could realistically approach using the strategies discussed in this module.
    * Inner Circle (warmest relationships): List 5–10 names
    * Community Circle (shared values or proximity): List 5–10 names
    * Institutional Circle (organizations or funders): List 5–10 names
    * Public Circle (followers, audiences, visibility): List 5–10 names
    * Legacy Circle (long-term partners or major supporters): List 3–5 names

Exercise Step 4: Choose Your First Moves
1. Select 5–10 unique names across any circle that you will intentionally approach in the next 60–90 days. For each, note:
    * Which circle they’re in
    * The strategy you’ll use (personal ask, meeting, story share, invitation, proposal, etc.)
You are not “starting fundraising.” You are choosing your next conversations.

CHANNELS: [done]

Homework: Fundraising Channels Inventory & Planning
The goal of this exercise is to understand which channels you are currently using, where your energy is concentrated, and which additional channels may be worth developing over the next year.

Step 1: Digital Channels

☐ Small gatherings or house meetings ☐ Community events or tabling ☐ Workshops, panels, or webinars ☐ Benefit dinners or receptions ☐ Walks, runs, or public fundraisers ☐ Open houses or site visits ☐ Program showcases or graduations ☐ Board-hosted events ☐ Other in-person channels: ___________________

Step 3: Peer & Community Channels
Check all that apply.
☐ Peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns ☐ Board or volunteer-led outreach ☐ Personal introductions and referrals ☐ Community partnerships or co-hosted events ☐ Faith-based or civic group outreach ☐ Birthday or celebration fundraisers ☐ Ambassador or champion programs ☐ Earned media (press, podcasts, interviews) ☐ Speaking engagements or presentations ☐ Thought leadership (op-eds, data, public commentary) ☐ Other peer/community channels: ___________________

Step 4: Looking Ahead
1. Are there one or more channels you believe would be effective to intentionally develop over the next year? ☐ Yes ☐ No
If yes, which channels and why?
* Channel(s): ___________________________________
* Reason (audience fit, capacity, mission alignment, growth potential):

STORYTELLING AND ASK: [done]

Homework: Developing Your Case for Support
The purpose of this assignment is to help you clearly articulate why your work matters, why it is effective, and why someone should care enough to support it—in your own voice first, and then with the help of AI to adapt it for different contexts.

Step 1: Write Your Personal Case for Support
Using the Case for Support outline from this module, write a full draft in your own words.
Focus on clarity, not perfection. This version should sound like you explaining the work to someone you trust.
Include:
* The problem you are addressing
* Why it matters
* Your solution and what makes it effective
* Who benefits and how
* The impact you are creating
* An implicit or explicit invitation to support the work
(a) Your Personal Case for Support (Draft)

[Text box]

Step 2: Use AI to Create Alternate Versions
Once your personal draft is complete, use AI as a refinement and adaptation tool—not a replacement for your thinking.
You may prompt AI with something like:
“Using the case for support below, create a shorter version for a general donor audience…”
or
“Rewrite this case for support for a more detailed funder or institutional audience…”
(b) Short AI-Generated Case for Support
(Concise, donor-friendly, 1–2 short paragraphs)

[Text box]
(c) Long AI-Generated Case for Support
(More detailed, suitable for proposals, major donors, or websites)

[Text box]

Step 3: Create an Elevator Pitch
Finally, ask AI to generate a 30–60 second elevator pitch based on your original draft.
This version should be:
* Clear
* Human
* Memorable
* Easy to say out loud
(d) Elevator Pitch Version

[Text box]

Optional Reflection (1–2 sentences)
What felt strongest or most authentic in your personal draft—and what improved when you saw your message adapted into different formats?

Coaching Note:
We strongly encourage signing up for a coaching session to further develop the ask portion of your case for support. The ask is highly dependent on the audience, relationship stage, timing, location, and mode of communication—and fine-tuning it is often the difference between a message that feels good and one that actually leads to action. A coaching session allows us to tailor the ask to your specific context and help you practice it with clarity and confidence.

TOOLS AND SYSTEMS: [done]

Question 1: Current Tools
Please list any tools or systems you are currently using to support fundraising, communications, events, donor tracking, or financial transparency.
Examples (list only what applies to you):
* CRM or donor tracking (e.g., Monkeypod, Bloomerang, spreadsheet, none)
* Email or communications (e.g., Mailchimp, Monkeypod, Substack)
* Online giving or crowdfunding platforms
* Event tools
* Social media or scheduling tools
* Design or content tools
* Accounting or financial tools

[Text box]

Question 2: Tools You’d Like Help With
Please list any tools or systems you would like support in learning more about or setting up.
This might include:
* Choosing or setting up a CRM
* Migrating contacts from email, phone, or spreadsheets
* Automating follow-ups or thank-yous
* Improving email or storytelling systems
* Selecting tools that match your size and capacity
* Integrating tools so they work together smoothly

[Text box]

CORPORATE STRATEGY: [done]

Homework: Corporate Giving Strategy & Network Mapping
The goal of this exercise is to help you identify which types of corporations are the best fit for your organization, and to think intentionally about how to access decision-makers through your existing networks.

Step 1: Identify High-Fit Corporate Sectors
Based on your mission, programs, and the communities you serve:
What types of corporations would be the most natural fit for your organization? (Think alignment, not just size.)
Examples:
* Financial institutions (banks, credit unions, fintech)
* Healthcare systems or insurers
* Law firms or professional services
* Construction, trades, or real estate
* Technology or data firms
* Retail, food, or consumer brands
* Logistics or manufacturing
* Media or communications firms

[List 3–5 corporate sectors that feel like strong fits]

Step 2: Identify Specific Companies
Within those sectors, list specific companies that:
* Operate in your region
* Share your values
* Serve a similar population
* Have employees who might care about your mission
* Already fund work like yours

[List 5–10 specific companies]

Step 3: Map Your Network Access
For each company you listed, answer the following:
* Do we know anyone who works there?
* Is that person a:
    * ☐ Board member
    * ☐ Volunteer
    * ☐ Donor
    * ☐ Client or alumni
    * ☐ Personal or professional contact
* Could that person reasonably help us get:
    * ☐ A conversation with a VP, SVP, or President
    * ☐ A referral to the company’s philanthropic or CSR office
    * ☐ An introduction to someone with influence

[Notes / names / connections]
Remember: The goal is a warm, senior-level conversation first — not cold outreach.

Step 4: Define the Entry Strategy
For 2–3 priority companies, briefly outline:
* Who the ideal first conversation would be with (title, not just role)
* What you would ask for initially:
    * A conversation
    * Advice
    * A referral
    * Employee engagement
    * Event partnership
* How your mission connects to what the company cares about (employee engagement, visibility, impact, values)

[Short strategy notes]

Coaching Note
We strongly encourage scheduling a coaching session to refine your corporate giving strategy. Identifying the right corporations is only the first step—the real leverage comes from mapping relationships, crafting the right entry point, and positioning the conversation at the senior leadership level. A coaching session can help you pressure-test fit, uncover hidden network connections, and plan a clear path from conversation to partnership.
