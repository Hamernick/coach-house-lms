    title: "Our Fiscal Sponsorship Model",
    markdown: `Coach House fiscally sponsors community-based, civic, and mission-driven projects that are charitable in nature, primarily noncommercial, and aligned with a clear public benefit.

The program is structured as a **Model C grantor-grantee relationship**:

- Coach House serves as the fiscal sponsor and grantor.
- The project or organization serves as the sponsored entity and grantee.
- Donors, foundations, corporations, or public entities give to Coach House for the benefit of the approved project.
- Coach House then makes charitable grants to support approved project expenses.

This lets projects without their own 501(c)(3) status receive tax-deductible donations, apply for many grants, establish financial credibility, and operate with appropriate oversight.

While fiscally sponsored, the project keeps ownership and day-to-day control of its work. Coach House provides financial oversight, compliance guardrails, and review of fundraising materials. The relationship is not a partnership, joint venture, or employment arrangement.`,

    markdown: `A project must serve a clear public benefit and be charitable in nature, consistent with Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

To be considered, the applicant must:

- Be engaged with Coach House through an approved intake pathway.
- Submit a complete application with project description, leadership background, preliminary budget, and intended fundraising activities.
- Operate for a charitable purpose.
- Be primarily non-commercial.
- Align with Coach House mission, values, risk standards, and readiness expectations.

Projects should not present legal, financial, or compliance risks that cannot be reasonably managed under fiscal sponsorship.`,

Coach House can review U.S.-based projects operating as:

- Individual / sole proprietor
- Informal group with an EIN
- Limited liability company
- Corporation
- Partnership

Coach House does not currently sponsor projects or organizations based outside the United States. The project must have a valid U.S. mailing address, working email address, internet access, and the ability to submit required information in writing.`,

- Legal name of the sponsored entity or individual
- Project name and approved charitable activities
- Legal status and tax reporting identity
- Fundraising and solicitation commitments
- Administrative fee terms
- Reporting, recordkeeping, and prohibited activity acknowledgements
- Applicant signature and Coach House countersignature

Approved materials should clearly disclose the fiscal sponsorship relationship. The short disclosure pattern is:

> [Project Name] is fiscally sponsored by Coach House Solutions Group, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. All donations are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law and are made to Coach House Solutions Group in support of [Project Name].

Applicants may not represent themselves as a 501(c)(3), use Coach House's EIN without written authorization, or make commitments on behalf of Coach House.`,

- Internal project setup and restricted fund records
- External onboarding and grantee responsibilities
- Receipt, review, deposit, and recording of funds
- Donor acknowledgment and disclosure language
- Grant request review, approval, and payment documentation
- Post-disbursement reporting and issue follow-up`,
