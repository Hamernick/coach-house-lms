  answer:
    "A nonprofit framework is a structured way to examine a decision, organize shared thinking, expose assumptions, and connect strategy to action. Choose the framework for the question you need to answer, build it with people closest to the work, and revise it when evidence or context changes.",

  definition:
    "A framework is a bounded representation that helps a group ask consistent questions and make a decision. A systems map explores context and relationships. A theory of change explains how and why actions are expected to contribute to change. A logic model organizes resources, activities, direct outputs, and sequenced outcomes. A responsibility map clarifies ownership and participation. A learning cycle turns uncertainty into questions, evidence, interpretation, and adaptation. These tools can connect, but they are not interchangeable and none proves that a program works.",
  whyItMatters: [
    "A shared model lets staff, participants, board members, partners, funders, and evaluators identify where they agree, where definitions differ, and which links remain assumptions.",
    "Separating resources, activities, outputs, outcomes, and longer-term contribution prevents delivery volume from being presented as community change.",
    "Naming context and assumptions makes a program easier to pilot, measure, challenge, and adapt without pretending the organization controls every condition around it.",
    "Choosing a framework by decision need reduces template theater: the team can use the smallest useful tool, keep a record, and stop when the decision is clear enough to act.",
  ],
  importantNote:
    "A framework documents a current hypothesis or operating agreement. It does not establish causality, effectiveness, feasibility, community consent, or impact. Those require proportionate evidence, interpretation, and continued review.",

      question: "What needs to be understood before choosing a solution?",
      guidance:
        "Start with the need, people affected, history, existing efforts, system conditions, and limits of the organization’s perspective. A systems map and early theory of change can keep a promising idea from becoming an untested program assumption.",
      actions: [
        "Invite people closest to the issue to identify conditions, actors, relationships, assets, exclusions, prior efforts, and unanswered questions.",
        "Draft several possible change pathways instead of treating the first intervention idea as inevitable.",
        "Mark what comes from community input, lived experience, research, administrative data, organizational belief, or an unresolved question.",
      ],

      question: "Can the organization explain how the program should work?",
      guidance:
        "Connect the need statement, mission, theory of change, program design, resources, responsibilities, and early evidence. Keep the model specific enough to guide a pilot and flexible enough to revise.",

        "Write an If, Then, So That theory of change with explicit assumptions and alternative explanations.",
        "Build a one-page logic model that distinguishes inputs, participant experience, outputs, and near-, intermediate-, and long-term outcomes.",

      label: "Operating",
      question: "Does the working model match actual delivery and learning?",
      guidance:
        "Use the framework as an operating reference rather than a proposal artifact. Compare planned activities and outputs with what happened, then interpret outcomes and access conditions with participants and partners.",
      actions: [
        "Review the model alongside budgets, staffing, schedules, program records, participant experience, outcome evidence, and unexpected effects.",
        "Define terms, data sources, owners, timing, disaggregation, evidence limits, and decisions before collecting additional information.",
        "Record what changed in the program or model, why it changed, whose input shaped the decision, and what will be reviewed next.",

      label: "Growing",
      question:
        "Can multiple teams use and challenge the frameworks consistently?",
      guidance:
        "Growth requires shared definitions, model ownership, version history, evidence governance, and room for program-specific context. Scaling a diagram without testing capacity, fidelity, access, and external conditions can scale the wrong thing.",
      actions: [
        "Maintain a portfolio view that connects organization-level strategy with distinct program models, responsibilities, evidence, and risks.",
        "Set review triggers for major context shifts, new evidence, participant harm or exclusion, program changes, staffing changes, and expansion decisions.",
        "Compare sites or programs without erasing differences in people, place, implementation, resources, access, or evidence quality.",

      checkpoint:
        "Each model has an owner, purpose, scope, definitions, evidence state, revision history, decision use, and a clear relationship to other organizational models.",

    strong:

    "Pathway integrity: activities, outputs, outcomes, timing, resources, and responsibilities remain aligned in actual operations rather than only in the diagram.",
    "Learning use: evidence is connected to a focused question and results in a recorded confirmation, revision, pause, test, or stop decision.",
